                <p>
                Games played on three-in-a-row boards can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where such game boards have been
                found on roofing tiles dating from around 1300 BC. An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire,
                around the first century BC.

                <p>
                    The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
                    You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
                    The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
                    When all the squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
